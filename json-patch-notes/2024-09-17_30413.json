The way the fix is implemented is that each player can only be considered for an enemy trooper death event 4 times per wave number during the laning phase.\n- Fixed troopers sometimes not dying after doing their death flash state\n- Fixed Unstoppable state not preventing fire rate reductions\n- Fixed Grey Talon's Charge Shot and Vindicta's Assassinate cameras not working properly",
