Pre 10 min, lanes now always split orbs when there are more heroes than the assigned participants for that lane (3+ people in a dual lane, 2+ people in a solo). Previously it only split with 3+ people regardless of the lane, which is what allowed soul abuses when dipping into a solo lane.\n- Private lobbies can now assign players to duo and solo lanes\n- Fixed some recent bugs with Vindicta Flight that could cause some large bursts in a direction\n- Fixed being able to shoot while using Ethereal Shift and flying with Vindicta\n- Veil Walker: Fire Rate reduced from 30% to 20%",
