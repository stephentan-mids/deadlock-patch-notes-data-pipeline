    "content": "[ General Changes ]\n- Added new hero, Mirage.\n- Added an initial Anti-Cheat detection system. When a user is detected as cheating, during the game session the opponents will be given a choice between banning the user immediately and ending the match or turning the cheater into a frog for the rest of the game and then banning them afterwards. The system is set to conservative detection levels as we work on a v2 anti-cheat system that is more extensive. We will turn on the banning of users in a couple of days after the update is out. When a match is ended this way, the results will not count for other players.\n- Added global quickcast support. You can now configure your abilities and/or items to be on quickcast mode globally.
