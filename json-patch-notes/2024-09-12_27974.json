Players can temporarily lose access to certain capabilities in the game. The controls include Matchmaking, Voice Chat, Text Chat, Pausing, and Reporting. The system for tracking is active now, however we will wait on most penalties for a few days as we review the results.\n- There is now a low priority queue. The primary way to enter this is through abandoning games, but it can include other behavior. You must complete the required amount of games (escalates based on low priority frequency) to be able to return to using matchmaking normally.\n- Regularly misreporting players will result in you losing the reporting function and may in some cases cause you to go into low priority as well.\n- New players that are queued solo will only match with other new players until they get 4 wins\n- The lane allocation of 1-1-2-2- and 2-2-1-1 will no longer be a possible setup\n- A 6 player party will no longer match against solo players. This may result in longer queue times for 6 stacks.\n- AFK players will be automatically kicked out after a few minutes\n- Abandon Match dialog is now more clear about consequences of leaving\n- Abandon Match now has a time delay before you can click it to help protect against some accidental cases\n- Added custom hotkeys per hero\n- Bounce Pad visuals have been replaced with a wind fan (no mechanic changes). The effects also indicate the travel path.\n- Added little spirit frog legs to the Soul Urn\n- Orange zipline is now green\n- Space Bar no longer cancels abilities. Abilities can be pressed again to cancel the ones that have a cancel state.\n- The Alternate Cast modes \"Modifier Button\" and \"Alternate Cast Button\" have had their behaviors merged\n- Added UI button hints when using \"Alternate Cast Button\" in some extra cases\n- Added a slider for Double Tap Alternate Cast timing\n- Added a slider for Press and Hold Alternate Cast required time\n-Changes to Scoreboard (TAB) and Extra Info (ALT)\nPreviously there was a lot of crossover between the TAB and ALT modes during gameplay. In this update we have separated the behavior of these two modes to better serve different functions. The keys used for each of these modes can be swapped within Keybinds Settings.\u200b\n\u200b\nScoreboard (TAB):\u200b\n- Enables cursor mode\u200b\n- Displays Scoreboard\u200b\n- Displays Damage Summary\u200b\n- Allows minimap ping and draw\u200b\n\u200b\nExtra Info (ALT):\u200b\n- No longer enables cursor mode\u200b\n- Quick-upgrade Abilities (ie.

This has very temp UI. Once we add a real UI to it along with some misc features, we'll add a non-console way to host custom lobbies.\n- Upgrade ability keys are now customizable (Current defaults are ALT+1, ALT+2, etc)\n- Adjusted Midboss low health roar sound to be more distinct from spawn sound\n- Added Maximum FPS Sliders for Dashboard and In-Game\n- Removed Pause limit for hero testing, coop bot matches, and the tutorial\n- Added support for launching the game in a secondary monitor properly\n- Fixed friends menu scrolling up automatically when it shouldn't\n- Fixed being unable to invite offline users to a party\n- Fixed invite tooltips on friends menu not being positioned correctly\n- Metal Skin effects revisions\n- Seven's Static Charge effects improvement to make the boundary more clear\n- Updated medic healing beam colors to be consistent with other heals\n- Melee troopers no longer play swipe effect (to reduce some unnecessary noise)\n- Added better indication when all four active slots are full\n- Updated Ice Dome to fix some performance related issues\n- Updated Torment visual effects to reduce some noise\n- Added sound for Tesla Bullets proc\n- Added sound for Toxic Bullets proc\n-
