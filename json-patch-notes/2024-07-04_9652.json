Testing times for this region are Mon-Thur 5PM to 3AM and Fri-Sun 3PM to 3AM in China Standard Time (GMT+8).\n- Added South America servers and matchmaking region. Testing times for this region are Mon-Thur 5PM to 3AM and Fri-Sun 3PM to 3AM in Atlantic Standard Time (GMT-4).\n- Added a new Damage Report feature. You can now open a flyout panel within the shop to view a breakdown of your hero's incoming and outgoing damage throughout the course of a match. You can also hover an enemy hero to view a quick breakdown of their key stats and items. The data can be filtered by last respawn, 10 minutes, 5 minutes, 3 minutes, 1 minute, or 30 seconds.\n- Reworked the top bar HUD to reduce overall height\n- While spectating or watching replays, the game now has a free cursor mode without needing to hold modifiers down (defaulted to on). Can toggle it off while spectating using the 'J' key.\n- Minimap now displays dead heroes for 5 seconds after their death\n- Reworked the default suggested items for heroes to be much more simple (oriented more strongly for new player onboarding)\n- Parties will now be a little more likely to be in the same lane, if there isn't a wide skill gap or other factors preventing it\n- All instances of collecting souls  (whether claiming your own or denying an opponent) will share the same sound. Being denied a soul orb by an enemy will have its own unique sound.\n- Fixed the HUD cooldown state thrashing while picking up the Soul Urn\n- Fixed Spectral Wall sometimes not spawning depending on the map geometry nearby\n- Added descriptive tooltips to Render and Audio options within settings. Render tooltips include an estimate of performance impact where applicable.\n- Fixed a bug where bullets could penetrate close range targets and hit 2 targets when not intended (was primarily obvious with neutral farming)\n- Reduced the end of match delay from 10s to 4s\n- Added a shatter sound effect for meleeing the mid boss rejuvenator\n- Added ghost models inside the doorways of the juke closets to help clarify which are dead ends\n- Fixed position of the \"All Walkers Destroyed\" Flex slot to be the 2nd slot rather than the 4th\n- Added a sound for when Infernus's Afterburn procs\n- Added rejuvenator pickup sound\n- Minimap now highlights Soul Urn dropoff location\n- Updated Wraith Full Auto cast sound\n- Added audio feedback for environmental damage\n- Fixed sounds associated with last hit playing unreliably\n- Updated sounds for Wraith Card Trick projectile, impact, and when you gain a card\n- Added traffic and construction ambient sounds and updated general ambience mix\n[ Misc Gameplay]\n- Urn count changed from 2 to 1 (previous souls value restored)\n- Urn pickup location moved to closer to the outer lanes (on the opposite side of the lane pillar, facing towards the bridge)\n- Urn drop-off location now move to the same spot as the pickup (opposite end of the map, depending on which location the Urn spawns in)\n- Urn pickup time reduced from 4s to 2s\n- Urn now has a 2s drop-off time\n- Urn no longer applies a 15% slow\n- Urn now prevents you from using the zipline while carrying it\n- The person delivering the urn now gets +25% soul bonus\n- Reworked how Powerups work.
