    "This notebook uses Beautiful Soup to scrape Valve's video game Deadlock's changelog page to get the links to all patch notes (updates). Each patch note is extracted from the page by parsing the HTML and finding the tags that link to the individual patch notes. Based on the URL structure, loop through and extract the text data from each individual patch note. Store the extracted (raw) data in a .txt file. Data is first stored locally for initial development and then pushed to Google Cloud Storage in batch.\n",
