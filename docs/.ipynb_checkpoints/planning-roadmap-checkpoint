Project Objectives: Deadlock is a team-based video game made by Valve. The objective of this project is to create a data pipeline that extracts patch note data and store it in the cloud.

This project is broken down into 3 main phases.
Phase 1 (jupyter notebook): For each patch note, store the raw data into a single .txt file 
	[EDIT 27nov2024] instead of a .txt file, put each patch note into it's own .json file
Phase 2 (vscode): Store the data in Google Cloud Storage (GCS)
Phase 3 (vscode): Set up automation for previous phases.

Possible Downstream Analyses
1. Patch note sumamrizer for which selectable characters received the biggest positive changes -- "buffs" -- and negative changes -- "nerfs"
2. Recommendation tool that suggests the best builds for each character based on patch notes
3. Sentiment analysis from Reddit thread r/DeadlockTheGame that compares user feedback on each patch
